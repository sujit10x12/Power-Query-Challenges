 ## 1. Basic Transformations

## Challenge
 - Create a new CSV query to fetch data for **File 1Z**.
 - Clean and reshape the raw CSV data into a structured format for analysis.

### Steps Overview
- **Removed Top/Bottom Rows** ‚Äì Skipped the first 8 and last 2 rows (extra notes/headers).  
- **Promoted Headers** ‚Äì Used the first row as column headers.  
- **Removed Columns** ‚Äì Dropped `Ref1` and `Ref2`.  
- **Replaced Values** ‚Äì Converted blanks in `Metric` to null.  
- **Filled Down** ‚Äì Filled down `Metric` values for missing rows.  
- **Unpivoted Columns** ‚Äì Converted date columns into row values.  
- **Renamed Columns** ‚Äì Renamed `Attribute` ‚Üí `Date`.  
- **Pivoted Columns** ‚Äì Reshaped `Metric` column into separate fields (`Margin`, `Sales`).  
- **Duplicated Date Column** ‚Äì Created a backup (`Date - Copy`).  
- **Parsed Date** ‚Äì Converted `Date` into proper date format.  
- **Kept Errors** ‚Äì Retained only rows with parsing errors (e.g., non-standard values).  
- **Removed Columns** ‚Äì Dropped original `Date` column.  
- **Filtered Rows** ‚Äì Removed 2017 and 2018 from the backup date column.  
- **Renamed Column** ‚Äì Renamed `Date - Copy` ‚Üí `Quarter`.  
- **Changed Types** ‚Äì Converted fields into correct data types (numbers, integers, dates).   

### Outcome
The final dataset provides:  
- **Quarterly Sales & Margin** data  
- Clean categories and store references  
- Structured format ready for reporting and analysis

## 2. Extracting Data

## Challenge
 - Create a new CSV query to fetch data for **File 2Z**.
 - Transform the *Duty Free Margins Dataset B* into a clean, structured dataset for analysis.

### Steps Overview
- **Removed Top Rows** ‚Äì Skipped first 4 rows containing non-data.  
- **Split Column** ‚Äì Broke `Column4` into multiple columns using `" | "` as delimiter.  
- **Promoted Headers** ‚Äì Used first row as headers.  
- **Filtered Rows** ‚Äì Removed nulls in `Product Details`.  
- **Split Product Details** ‚Äì Divided into `Division` and `Department` by `-`.  
- **Extracted Last Characters** ‚Äì Kept only the last character of `Division`.  
- **Added Prefix** ‚Äì Added `"Division "` before the extracted character.  
- **Renamed Columns** ‚Äì Assigned proper names (`Division`, `Department`).  
- **Uppercased Text** ‚Äì Standardized `Department` values to uppercase.  
- **Split Brands** ‚Äì Split `Brands` column by `;` into multiple rows.  
- **Trimmed Text** ‚Äì Removed extra spaces from `Brands`.  
- **Filtered Rows** ‚Äì Removed empty brand values.  
- **Unpivoted Other Columns** ‚Äì Reshaped quarterly columns into row format.  
- **Renamed Columns** ‚Äì `Attribute` ‚Üí `Quarter`, `Value` ‚Üí `Margin`.  
- **Changed Type** ‚Äì Converted `Margin` column to number.  

### Outcome
The final dataset contains:  
- **Division, Department, Supplier, Brand, Quarter, Margin**  
- Cleaned, standardized, and reshaped values  
- Ready for analysis of duty-free margins by division, department, and brand.

## 3. Consolidating Data

## Challenge
 - Create a new CSV query to fetch data for **File 3Z**.
 - Aggregate daily sales and margin data from multiple managers into a clean monthly summary.

### Steps Overview
- Added **Total Sales** by summing all manager sales.  
- Calculated individual manager margins (`Sales √ó Margin`) and total margin.  
- Cleaned up by removing intermediate calculation columns.  
- Transformed **Transaction Date** to the first day of the month.  
- Grouped data by month to compute **Total Sales** and **Total Margin**.  

### Outcome
The final dataset provides a **monthly view of total sales and margins**, aggregated across all managers.

## 4. Categorizing Sales Data ‚Äì Exercise 4Z

**Challenge:**  
- Create a new CSV query to fetch data for **File 4Z**.
- Transform raw sales data by mapping category codes to readable labels and cleaning the dataset.

<img width="1280" height="720" alt="4z - Dealing with Errors" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc1e4b56-c30e-4075-ac97-626411e1a17a" />

### Steps Overview
- Promoted headers for proper column names.  
- Added a conditional column to map category codes (`ALC`, `TOB`, `FD`, `LXY`, `PER`) into meaningful labels (Alcohol, Tobacco, Food, Luxury, Perfume, Other).  
- Filtered out rows with null `Sales` values.  
- Removed the original `Cat` column.  
- Converted `Date` column to **date format** (UK locale).  
- Adjusted data types for `Sales` (number) and `Category` (text).  

### Outcome
A **clean, categorized sales dataset** with proper labels, valid dates, and numeric sales values ‚Äî ready for reporting or analysis.
