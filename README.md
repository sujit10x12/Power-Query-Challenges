 ## 1. Basic Transformations

## Challenge
 - Create a new CSV query to fetch data for **File 1Z**.
 - Clean and reshape the raw CSV data into a structured format for analysis.

### Steps Overview
- **Removed Top/Bottom Rows** – Skipped the first 8 and last 2 rows (extra notes/headers).  
- **Promoted Headers** – Used the first row as column headers.  
- **Removed Columns** – Dropped `Ref1` and `Ref2`.  
- **Replaced Values** – Converted blanks in `Metric` to null.  
- **Filled Down** – Filled down `Metric` values for missing rows.  
- **Unpivoted Columns** – Converted date columns into row values.  
- **Renamed Columns** – Renamed `Attribute` → `Date`.  
- **Pivoted Columns** – Reshaped `Metric` column into separate fields (`Margin`, `Sales`).  
- **Duplicated Date Column** – Created a backup (`Date - Copy`).  
- **Parsed Date** – Converted `Date` into proper date format.  
- **Kept Errors** – Retained only rows with parsing errors (e.g., non-standard values).  
- **Removed Columns** – Dropped original `Date` column.  
- **Filtered Rows** – Removed 2017 and 2018 from the backup date column.  
- **Renamed Column** – Renamed `Date - Copy` → `Quarter`.  
- **Changed Types** – Converted fields into correct data types (numbers, integers, dates).   

### Outcome
The final dataset provides:  
- **Quarterly Sales & Margin** data  
- Clean categories and store references  
- Structured format ready for reporting and analysis

## 2. Extracting Data

## Challenge
 - Create a new CSV query to fetch data for **File 2Z**.
 - Transform the *Duty Free Margins Dataset B* into a clean, structured dataset for analysis.

### Steps Overview
- **Removed Top Rows** – Skipped first 4 rows containing non-data.  
- **Split Column** – Broke `Column4` into multiple columns using `" | "` as delimiter.  
- **Promoted Headers** – Used first row as headers.  
- **Filtered Rows** – Removed nulls in `Product Details`.  
- **Split Product Details** – Divided into `Division` and `Department` by `-`.  
- **Extracted Last Characters** – Kept only the last character of `Division`.  
- **Added Prefix** – Added `"Division "` before the extracted character.  
- **Renamed Columns** – Assigned proper names (`Division`, `Department`).  
- **Uppercased Text** – Standardized `Department` values to uppercase.  
- **Split Brands** – Split `Brands` column by `;` into multiple rows.  
- **Trimmed Text** – Removed extra spaces from `Brands`.  
- **Filtered Rows** – Removed empty brand values.  
- **Unpivoted Other Columns** – Reshaped quarterly columns into row format.  
- **Renamed Columns** – `Attribute` → `Quarter`, `Value` → `Margin`.  
- **Changed Type** – Converted `Margin` column to number.  

### Outcome
The final dataset contains:  
- **Division, Department, Supplier, Brand, Quarter, Margin**  
- Cleaned, standardized, and reshaped values  
- Ready for analysis of duty-free margins by division, department, and brand.

## 3. Consolidating Data

## Challenge
 - Create a new CSV query to fetch data for **File 3Z**.
 - Aggregate daily sales and margin data from multiple managers into a clean monthly summary.

### Steps Overview
- Added **Total Sales** by summing all manager sales.  
- Calculated individual manager margins (`Sales × Margin`) and total margin.  
- Cleaned up by removing intermediate calculation columns.  
- Transformed **Transaction Date** to the first day of the month.  
- Grouped data by month to compute **Total Sales** and **Total Margin**.  

### Outcome
The final dataset provides a **monthly view of total sales and margins**, aggregated across all managers.

## 4. Categorizing Sales Data – Exercise 4Z

## Challenge
- Create a new CSV query to fetch data for **File 4Z**.
- Transform raw sales data by mapping category codes to readable labels and cleaning the dataset.

<img width="1280" height="720" alt="4z - Dealing with Errors" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc1e4b56-c30e-4075-ac97-626411e1a17a" />

### Steps Overview
- Promoted headers for proper column names.  
- Added a conditional column to map category codes (`ALC`, `TOB`, `FD`, `LXY`, `PER`) into meaningful labels (Alcohol, Tobacco, Food, Luxury, Perfume, Other).  
- Filtered out rows with null `Sales` values.  
- Removed the original `Cat` column.  
- Converted `Date` column to **date format** (UK locale).  
- Adjusted data types for `Sales` (number) and `Category` (text).  

### Outcome
A **clean, categorized sales dataset** with proper labels, valid dates, and numeric sales values — ready for reporting or analysis.

## Assessment A – Sales Aggregation

## Challenge
Transform the raw CSV dataset with hundreds of columns into a clean, aggregated table, focusing on Store 2.

<img width="1280" height="720" alt="Assessment A" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/231e3ee0-8d99-49e9-8fa3-d766e88e14b1" />


### Steps Overview
- Removed extra top rows and unnecessary columns.  
- Promoted headers to column names.  
- Unpivoted the dataset (from wide to long format).  
- Filled down missing `Store` values and converted blanks to null.  
- Converted `Value` to numeric type.  
- Grouped data by **Store** and **Attribute**, calculating total **Sales**.  
- Filtered to keep only **Store = 2**.  

### Outcome
The final dataset contains **summed sales by Store 2** across all attributes, reshaped into a clean long format for analysis.

## Assessment B 

## Challenge  
Prepare and standardize **GL Accounts** and **GL Transactions** data to build a clean chart of accounts, enrich account details, and summarize transactions for reporting.  


## Steps Overview  

- **GL Accounts**  
  - Loaded *Accounts* sheet.  
  - Created unified **Name** column (Balance Sheet / Income Statement).  
  - Removed unnecessary columns.  

- **Accounts**

- **GL Transactions**  
  - Cleaned and promoted headers.  
  - Grouped by `GL Account` and summed **Amount**.  
  - Merged with **GLAccounts** to attach account names.


## Outcome  
- A **standardized chart of accounts** with consistent naming.  
- A **refined Accounts table** enriched with GL account names.  
- A **summarized Transactions table** showing account totals with names.  
- Final dataset is structured and ready for **financial analysis and reporting**.

## Assessment C

## Challenge  
Combine multiple files from a folder, clean and transform the data, and produce a summarized view of values grouped by **Category (Cat)**.  

<img width="1280" height="720" alt="Assessment C" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23fa82aa-16d3-4709-8187-e4f5371d7e03" />

## Steps Overview  

- **Load Data**

  - Removed unnecessary columns (`Source.Name`, `Metric`, `Store`, `Attribute`).  
  - Changed **Value** column to numeric.  

- **Data Transformation**  
  - Grouped rows by **Cat**.  
  - Summed the **Value** column to calculate totals per category.
